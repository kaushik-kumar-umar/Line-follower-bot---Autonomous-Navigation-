# Line-follower-bot---Autonomous-Navigation-
Autonomous Line Follower Robot implementing real-time sensor-based decision logic and PID-controlled motor actuation to reliably navigate black-on-white and white-on-black tracks.
This project implements an autonomous mobile robot capable of following black-on-white and white-on-black paths using real-time sensor feedback. The system uses sensor-based decision logic combined with PID-tuned motor control to achieve smooth and stable trajectory tracking under varying lighting and surface conditions.

The robot is designed and tested on real hardware, focusing on robust navigation, control stability, and repeatable autonomous behavior.
